# Email Spam Classifier Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing techniques and TensorFlow.

## Dataset 

The dataset used in this project is a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. It contains two columns: `Category` (spam/ham) and `Message` (email text). The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `mail_data.csv`.

## Requirements 

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.12
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Model Architecture 

The model architecture used in this project is a feedforward neural network:

- **Input Layer:** Utilizes a TF-Hub layer to convert text into numerical embeddings.
- **Hidden Layers:** Two dense hidden layers with ReLU activation functions.
- **Output Layer:** Single neuron output layer with sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

## Usage 

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geekylakshya/Email_Spam_Classifier.git
cd Email_Spam_Classifier
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb to train the model and evaluate its performance.

3. After training the model, you can use it to classify new emails. Modify the input_mail variable in the notebook with the email text you want to classify, then run the cell containing the prediction code.

## Evaluation 

The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set, as well as on the training and validation sets during training. The evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss.

- Accuracy : 95%+

## Results 

The project provides insights into the effectiveness of using TensorFlow and natural language processing techniques for email spam classification. Results are visualized using Matplotlib.
